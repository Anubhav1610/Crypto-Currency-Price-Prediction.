# Crypto-Currency-Price-Prediction.
Crypto Currency Price Prediction is done using LSTM model.

In this model 80% of the data is used for training and the rset 20% is used for testing.

LSTM model - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. 
             It is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, 
             LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points, but also entire sequences of data.

Data Source - The data Source used in the notebook is extracted from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130429&end=20201107 using data scrapping
              extension tool Instant Data Scrapper ( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20130429&end=20201107 ) provided in Google Chrome or 
              Microsoft Edge. The notebook is used to for price prediction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Binance Coin and Chainlink, apart from these other 
              cryptocurreny price prediction can also be done, only the work reuired to be done is scrapping the data from Coinmarket using Instant Data Scrapper.
